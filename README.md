# Real-Time-Face-Detection-using-openCV

The following repository provides Python code that can perform real time face detection using opencv library. 
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) includes hundreds of Computer Vision algorithms that make it easier for implementation.
Haar Cascade Classifiers was used in this project, which is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a numnber of images.
The images contain positive and negative samples, which are used for training the model. 
haarcascade_frontalface_default was used to detect faces.
